       "      <td>It's perfectly reasonable for Parliament to show leadership by recommending that people avoid one type of thinking in favour of another. Here's a hypothetical example: a group of Canadians publicly promotes a change to the laws against sex with children. They point to their Charter right to hold such beliefs and express them. And they're correct: they have a right to their beliefs and to express them as well. Against such a trend, and especially if there was clear evidence that sex with children was on the rise, Parliament might pass a motion condemning those who promote it, while re-affirming society's abhorrence of the practice.\\n\\nThat is the principle here. Parliament is showing leadership, or trying to. They are condemning certain kinds of thinking while promoting another. It's both reasonable and desirable for them to do that against destructive forms of thought, emotion and action.</td>\n",

His has practical hands-on experience, while Carlson is just a graduate student at the U of O.  And her close ties to politics is disturbing. We need commissioners who will do what is best for the citizens and their pocket books, and not a person out to pursue a political agenda.\\n\\nThis whole obsession with sustainability is what has made EWEB's rates go so sky high. That decision to use that Seneca BIOMASS plant, which produces horrible air pollution, and extremely expensive electricity was insane. We cannot power our community by burning material from our forests.\\n\\nJust compare how cheap electricity is in Springfield, to the outrageous prices EWEB charges. For 1,600 kWh of electricity, EWEB charges residents $169.54  SUB's price for the same amount is only $97.42!!\\n\\nThat's a 74% increase for living in Eugene!!!!   \n",

This can only end badly for BC, but hopefully this \"coalition\" will soon fall apart. \\n\\nWake up people - no matter what socialist governments promise you to get elected (like no bridge tolls), they only are about higher taxes and increased provincial debt (I know many voters don't understand the consequences of the latter, but they will).   \n",

Here's a hypothetical example: a group of Canadians publicly promotes a change to the laws against sex with children. They point to their Charter right to hold such beliefs and express them. And they're correct: they have a right to their beliefs and to express them as well. Against such a trend, and especially if there was clear evidence that sex with children was on the rise, Parliament might pass a motion condemning those who promote it, while re-affirming society's abhorrence of the practice.\\n\\nThat is the principle here. Parliament is showing leadership, or trying to. They are condemning certain kinds of thinking while promoting another. It's both reasonable and desirable for them to do that against destructive forms of thought, emotion and action.   \n",
